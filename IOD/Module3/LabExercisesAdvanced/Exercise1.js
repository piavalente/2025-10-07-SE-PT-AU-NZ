/* makeCounter below is a decorator function which creates and returns a function that
increments a counter. */

/* a) Create a second counter counter2 using the makeCounter function and test to see if
it remains independent to counter1 -- YES. It is dependent to counter1.*/

/* b) Modify makeCounter so that it takes an argument startFrom specifying where the
counter starts from (instead of always starting from 0) */

/*c) Modify makeCounter to take another argument incrementBy, which specifies how
much each call to counter() should increase the counter value by.*/

let counter1 = makeCounter();
counter1(); // 1
counter1(); // 2

//second counter - same value as first counter
let counter2 = makeCounter();

//3rd counter - startsFrom 5 - with increments of 2
